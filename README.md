# Statistical-Analysis-for-Prediction-of-Heart-Disease-in-At-risk-Patients
The objective is to develop a predictive model that accurately identifies the likelihood of heart attack, enabling timely intervention and prevention of the disease.


The dataset contains 303 observations and 14 variables, including 13 predictor variables and 1 target variable.
The target variable "output" indicates whether a patient is at risk of having a heart attack (1) or not (0).
The predictor variables include age, sex, chest pain type, resting blood pressure, serum cholesterol level, fasting blood sugar level, electrocardiographic results, maximum heart rate achieved, exercise-induced angina, ST depression induced by exercise, the slope of the peak exercise ST segment, number of major vessels colored by fluoroscopy, and thalassemia.


To replicate results : 


Step 1. Unzip the project folder

Step 2. Open Terminal

Step 3. Go to the location that has the project using `cd` command
   Eg. `cd Desktop`        (if the project folder is placed in Desktop)

Step 4. Go to the project folder
	`cd Statistical-Analysis-for-Prediction-of-Heart-Disease-in-At-risk-Patients`

Step 5. Start Jupyter notebook to open the project. Just type 'jupyter notebook' in the terminal once inside the project folder.

Step 6. Once jupyter notebook dashboard is open and running, open notebook file `empirical_project_1.ipynb`. This file has all the codes that performs the required task in the project

Step 7. Run the notebook cells in order. You can select each cell and press SHIFT+ENTER to run the selected cell to see they results they produced. Alternatively you can use the Run button on top toolbar to run it.
